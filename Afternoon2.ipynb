    "A very common use case for inheritance is the creation of a custom exception hierarchy. Because we use the class of an exception to determine whether it should be caught by a particular except block, it is useful for us to define custom classes for exceptions which we want to raise in our code. Using inheritance in our classes is useful because if an except block catches a particular exception class, it will also catch its child classes (because a child class is its parent class). That means that we can efficiently write except blocks which handle groups of related exceptions, just by arranging them in a logical hierarchy. Our exception classes should inherit from Python’s built-in exception classes. They often won’t need to contain any additional attributes or methods.\n",
