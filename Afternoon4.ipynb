    "Welcome to the final afternoon.  Today's most important exercise is brainstorming where you can use you new skills.  Talk with your breakout group and come up with at least 3 ideas as a group of how you could use your new python skills at work.  Please post them to your class chat so others can see them and be inspired too. Remember that the only way to really learn a computer language is with your fingers, so find a project you might want to do.   \n",

    "Create a class called Numbers, which has a single class attribute called MULTIPLIER, and a constructor which takes the parameters x and y (these should all be numbers). Do this in a TDD fashion where you write the tests first in a test, then write the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a method called add which returns the sum of the attributes x and y.\n",
    "- Write a class method called multiply, which takes a single number parameter a and returns the product of a and MULTIPLIER.\n",
    "- Write a static method called subtract, which takes two number parameters, b and c, and returns b - c.\n",
    "- Write a method called value which returns a tuple containing the values of x and y. Make this method into a property, and write a setter and a deleter for manipulating the values of x and y. You may have to use @property, and we may not have gotten to this yet.  \n",

    "Can you take your code to look for vaccine appointments *or another project from this class or work* that you have done and code review it with your group, given what you have learned. If you don't want to use this example but you would prefer to use something more work related, go ahead. Are you using good syntax and code style? Functions or classes?  Can you write unit and functional tests for your code? Generally make it into something polished. \n",
